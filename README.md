# dotty-escape

This is a reimplemention of [scala-escape](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/scala-escape) coming in the form of a [Dotty](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty) fork. :smiley_cat:

### Is first [`First hacky experiment`](https://github.com/freddie-freeloader/dotty/commit/c4b2ae13df8e5fdbb2e762d8099dbf6434489cb1) your only commit?

Fortunately, there exists a bit more code to look at. The most recent code lives in the [local-implementation branch](https://github.com/freddie-freeloader/dotty/tree/local-implementation). :herb:
